Description: Typing stubs for cryptograpy
 This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the cryptography package. It can be
 used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code that
 uses cryptography. The source for this package can be found at
 https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/cryptography. All fixes
 for types and metadata should be contributed there.
